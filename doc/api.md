# API Specification

## Interface

LHS: *Bind, Match*

RHS: *Set, Add, Replace, Remove*

### Bind

`Bind(^member {block} as <binding>)`

If the first string is attribute-like (starts with caret), bind from this attribute series.  Otherwise defaults
to `^type`.

The next string will be a block, substituted in the functions context.  $binding be set to the bound object's binding.

If block is followed by two strings in the form of `as <binding>`, then binding will be set to the passed binding.
Otherwise an autogenerated binding will be used, in the form of `<typeX>`.

### Match

`Match(args)`

Convert each arg string into the corresponding Soar test.  Basic form is `{^member test value as <binding>}`

Test must be one of the following:

* `=` must equal value (either a binding or constant value, such as a String)
* `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` must be greater than, less than, greater or equal to, less or equal to the numeric value
  or binding.
* `s>`, `s<`, `s>=`, `s<=` stable variants of the previous.  Cannot be bound.

Multiple `test value` pairs can be included in a single match call.

### Add, Set, AddTo, Remove

`Set(^member <block>)`
